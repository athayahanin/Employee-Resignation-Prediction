# Employee-Resignation-Prediction
This case is from a data analytics competition I joined few years ago. My very first data analytics and machine learning competition! It was really funüòä

‚ÄºÔ∏è[Data aren't real, all dummy)‚ÄºÔ∏è

‚ÄúConDrossiers‚Äù CoDros is a company in Indonesia which is engaged in data management, data integration, and database systems whose purpose is to prepare management infrastructure. In addition, CoDros also plays a role in defining the company's work system that has not been well defined so that the company's business processes can operate properly.


After being in business for approximately 12 years, CoDros was faced with the COVID-19 pandemic situation in 2020. All of its employees were unable to do their jobs from the office and had to adapt to the work from home culture. As a result, there are allegations that this major change in the work system has resulted in changes in employee behavior, even increasing the company's turnover rate. This trend of employee resignation threatens the company's operational capabilities so that management needs to take action.

Ironically, the CoDros company has not properly documented its employee data. CoDros has only limited data on its employees. CoDros management wants to analyze the characteristics of employees to find out whether they will continue to work at CoDros or will resign in the near future. It is hoped that the results of the analysis and modeling carried out can become the forerunner of important steps that can be taken by management to increase employee satisfaction in the midst of this adaptation period.
